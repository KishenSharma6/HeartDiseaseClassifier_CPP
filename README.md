In the following repository, I will be building a simple classifier on the famous heart disease dataset from UCI ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)).

The aim of this mini-project is to gain additional practice with creating models from scratch in C++ and comparing their performances against their Python counterparts in Sklearn.
